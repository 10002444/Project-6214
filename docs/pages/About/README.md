<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi my name is Marisa, and I am a student at Toi Ohomai InstituteTechnology in Tauranga.
I am a kiwi girl from New Zealand. I love chocolate, animals, beauty, photography (being in front of the camera), and computers. I love learning things every day, gaming, hanging out with my family and exploring new area.
I am currently studying in my 2nd year of university. I have a diploma in Web Development and Design. My dream job would be a Web Developer/Programming, not sure what area yet but I know that’s what I want to do.
Here is my portfoilo about my jounrey with Toi-Ohomai and what I have learnt and achieve to get where I am today :)
